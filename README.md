##  What is part of this repo?
This repository contains the work and results of the master's thesis written by me. 

## Things to know 

The framework file itself is not a large contributor to the project, but if you would like to use the same structure as me, simply create an object and use the functions within the class. 
The main work came from choosing the prompts to assess the models and tinkering with the parameters. If you want to use the same questions and prompts as me, load the .npy files into your project. They are arrays of Strings that contain the questions, medical reasoning tasks, and medical conversations. Pass those arrays into the framework functions to obtain results. You could pass your own questions and tasks using these functions. 

### Organisation


- **Old/**: folder with the old results from earlier runs of the project.
- **GPT_SW3_framework.py**: class to utilise the functions in the framework. 
- **.npy**: numpy objects with the questions, reasoning tasks, and conversations. 
- **Results.xlsx**: Excel sheet with all of the results from the final runs and the results that were used for analysis for the thesis.
